This repo contains two seperate html and javacript finals each for the two levels of filtering. 

This first allows you to filter only by a provided date. It has both a form and a button submission. 

The second level allows you to filter by date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO. 
I found that when providing multiple text boxs, the form would not let me submit by pressing enter. 
After looking online, I found I needed a separate input with type="submit". 
After adding this, I removed the button as it seemed redundant. 
Also, I utilize a switch statement in my script. I learned about them in C++ and it helps reduce the clutter of multiply if statements here.
